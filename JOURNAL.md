## 2026-09-08: Deterministic Streamlit smoke boundary #decision

The blocking smoke path sets `TRADETELL_TEST_MODE=1` and uses an in-process fake RAG chain, so CI exercises the rendered question-and-source flow without Groq, Hugging Face, Chroma, or shared deployment services. The full demo remains separate and non-blocking; the smoke test is intentionally small and deterministic.

## 2026-08-29: ChromaDB advisory review #security

The app uses ChromaDB 1.5.9 through LangChain for three local persistent stores. GitHub reports four unpatched advisories. The app does not start a Chroma HTTP server or enable Hugging Face remote code execution, so CI records a temporary, exact-ID exception while Chroma remains in use. Revisit the exception when an upstream fix is available.

## 2026-08-14: Accessible plain-English documentation update #decision

Updated the README headline, summary tagline, and introduction to explain the trading assistant as an automated strategy coach for trading competitions. Replaced specialized jargon with intuitive concepts and removed all em dashes from the introductory prose.

## 2026-08-07 — Disk-persisted vector storage & RAG evaluation harness #milestone

Configured Chroma vector stores in `src/rag/build_rag_system.py`to persist index artifacts to`data/vectordb_persisted/`, eliminating cold-start re-embedding overhead. Created `docs/RAG-EVAL-AND-DECOUPLING-PLAN.md`detailing the roadmap for decoupling Streamlit to a FastAPI backend + React frontend, and added a automated RAG evaluation test suite in`tests/test_rag_eval.py`.

## 2026-06-13 — Demo suite was non-executable; wrote the missing step library #incident

A test audit found `e2e/demo/steps/`completely empty while`playwright.demo.config.ts`pointed`steps`at it — so every Gherkin step in the TradeTell tour was undefined and the demo suite couldn't run at all. The`01-tradetell-tour.feature`scenario was also truncated, ending on a dangling`When I open the retrieved sources`with no`Then`. Wrote `tradetell.steps.ts`reusing the selectors the two`probe*.mjs` scripts had already validated against the live app (`.app-title`, `[data-testid="stChatInput"] textarea`, `[data-testid="stChatMessage"]`, the "Retrieving context…" spinner text, and the `📚 N source document(s)`expander), plus a`dwell()`helper for demo pacing and 360s timeouts to absorb the RAG warm-up. Closed the feature with`Then I see the retrieved source documents`. `bddgen`+`playwright test --list`now resolve all steps and discover all 3 scenarios;`tsc --noEmit` is clean.

## 2026-06-10 — Repo brought up to the standard baseline #milestone

Added the missing project scaffolding in one pass: MIT `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`,
this journal, a custom SVG banner/logo, a `ci.yml` test gate + Dependabot, repo
metadata (description / homepage / topics), and a README overhaul with badges and
a Mermaid architecture diagram. The repo had shipped a full competition and a live
deploy with essentially a stock README; this closes that gap.

## 2026-06-10 — The Streamlit Cloud deploy cascade #incident

Reviving the deployed app surfaced a chain of failures, each hiding the next. The
GitHub repo rename (`imc_prosperity`→`IMC_Prosperity`) had severed the Streamlit↔GitHub
link, so Cloud was frozen on an ancient commit. Once reconnected: unpinned `langchain`
pulled 1.x and broke `langchain.retrievers`; Chroma's on-disk SQLite persistence failed
on `/mount`; and `import chromadb` crashed because the resolver pulled a 2022-era
OpenTelemetry whose protobuf-generated code is incompatible with a modern protobuf
runtime. Key lesson: a swallowed exception (the vector-store build `print`-and-continue)
turned a clear error into a cryptic `NoneType` crash three layers away — surfacing the
real error was the unlock.

## 2026-06-10 — Full dependency pin, then reverted #pivot

To stop the version whack-a-mole I pinned the entire `pip freeze` to reproduce local
exactly. It broke Cloud's install — ~150 transitive packages pinned to local (macOS)
versions, several without py3.14 Linux wheels (notably `numpy 1.26.4`). Reverted to
pinning **only** the packages that had resolved to broken versions (langchain 0.2.x,
a recent OpenTelemetry, `protobuf<7`) and let the resolver pick installable wheels for
everything else. Targeted pins beat a blanket freeze when the build and dev platforms
differ.

## 2026-06-10 — Backend pivot: Google GenAI → Claude CLI → Groq #pivot

The RAG backend moved twice. Off Google Generative AI to a local Claude CLI subprocess
(nice locally), then to the Groq HTTP API once it was clear the CLI binary can't exist
on Streamlit Cloud. Groq fits the deploy model: an API key in Streamlit secrets, no
local binary. The chain stays provider-agnostic behind `GroqRagChain.invoke`.

## 2026-06-10 — Housekeeping + UI redesign #milestone

Hardened `.gitignore` (an 826 MB vendored backtester clone, competition zips, data
dumps), migrated the Prosperity wiki from scraped JSON to Markdown, and dropped ~1.1 M
lines of round 3/4 test fixtures from tracking. Replaced the single-input Q&A page with
a proper chat UI (history, per-answer sources, example prompts, dark emerald theme).

## 2025-06-15 — Final placement #milestone

IMC Prosperity 4 wrapped; `final_placement.png` recorded the result.

## 2025-04 — Rounds 1–4 trading algorithms #milestone

Built and iterated the round algorithms: market-making on Rainforest Resin, Kelp, and
Squid Ink (round 1); basket arbitrage across the Picnic Baskets and their constituents —
Croissants, Jams, Djembes (round 2); volcanic rock vouchers (round 3); and magnificent
macarons with observation-driven signals (round 4).

## 2025-04-09 — RAG assistant initialized #decision

Stood up the assistant: a Notion scraper pulls the competition wiki to Markdown, which
is embedded into Chroma alongside trading data and extracted code, queried through an
ensemble retriever and a code-generation prompt, behind a Streamlit UI. The retriever
weights wiki / trading / code stores separately so algorithm requests pull real examples.
