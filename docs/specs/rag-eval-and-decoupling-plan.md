# TradeTell (IMC Prosperity): RAG Evaluation & Decoupling Architecture Roadmap

This document outlines the engineering plan for upgrading **TradeTell** (the AI assistant for IMC Prosperity) from a Streamlit application with in-process vector stores to a decoupled RAG application with continuous retrieval and generation evaluation.

---

## 1. Objectives

1. **Finish persistent indexing:** Add offline indexing and loading of an audited local index so cold starts do not rebuild the corpus unnecessarily.
2. **Decouple Frontend & Backend:**Transition from a unified Streamlit application to a dedicated**FastAPI**REST/SSE backend and a**React/Vite** frontend.
3. **Automated RAG Evaluation:** Establish continuous quality benchmarks measuring Retrieval Context Precision, Answer Faithfulness, and Groundedness.

## 2. Phase 1: Persistent Vector Indexing

`src/rag/build_rag_system.py` processes raw Markdown files, Discord exports, and code samples into in-process vector stores at runtime startup.

### Changes

- The local vector store currently builds its index in memory; no database service or persistent database files are required.
- Implement a CLI indexing script (`python -m src.rag.index_corpus`) to pre-build vector collections offline.
- If persistent indexing is added later, use a reviewed file format and keep loading local and read-only.

## 3. Phase 2: Decoupled FastAPI Backend

Separate UI state and streaming LLM inference from Python application code.

### Backend Architecture (FastAPI)

- **`/api/v1/health`**: Diagnostic check for vector database availability and Groq API key validity.
- **`/api/v1/chat`**: Standard JSON payload endpoint returning response, source document citations, and retrieval scores.
- **`/api/v1/chat/stream`**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint delivering real-time answer tokens to the frontend.
- **`/api/v1/trading/summarize`**: Async endpoint processing uploaded competition log CSVs/txt files.

## 4. Phase 3: Automated RAG Quality Evaluation Harness

Continuous quality gate running alongside pytest in CI (`pytest tests/test_rag_eval.py`).

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Context Recall & Precision:** Percentage of top-k retrieved chunks containing ground-truth answers for competition rules (e.g. position limits, trading round schedules).
2. **Answer Faithfulness:** LLM score assessing whether generated claims strictly derive from retrieved context without hallucination.
3. **Code Syntax Validity:** AST validation ensuring generated `Trader` classes compile without syntax errors.

## 5. Timeline & Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Disk-persisted vector storage implementation & cold-start benchmark (<1s vs 15s+).
- **Milestone 2:** Pytest evaluation suite with reference 20-question ground truth battery.
- **Milestone 3:** FastAPI routes & SSE streaming implementation.
